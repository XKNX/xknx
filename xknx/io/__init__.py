"""
This package contains all objects managing Tunneling and Routing Connections..

- KNXIPInterface is the overall managing class.
- GatewayScanner searches for available KNX/IP devices in the local network.
- Routing uses UDP/Multicast to communicate with KNX/IP device.
- Tunnelling uses UDP packets and builds a static tunnel with KNX/IP device.
