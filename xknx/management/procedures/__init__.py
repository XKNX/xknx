"""
Management procedures grouped by KNX spec family.

Subpackages are created when their first procedure lands. Naming mirrors
the KNX spec prefix:

  - ``network/`` for NM_* procedures (KNX 03.05.02 Network Management)
  - ``device/`` for DM_* procedures (KNX 03.05.02 Device Management)
  - ``ftp/`` for FTP_* procedures (KNX 03.05.02 §8 File Transfer)

Per-procedure files inside each subpackage host a single public ``async def``
function. This package re-exports every implemented procedure so callers can
import ``procedures`` via ``from xknx.management import procedures``, import
individual functions via ``from xknx.management.procedures import <func>``, or
access them as attributes such as ``procedures.<func>``.

When adding a new procedure follow the workflow:

  1. Create ``procedures/<family>/<spec_name>.py`` with the spec text embedded
     in the module docstring and ``raise NotImplementedError`` until impl lands.
  2. Mirror under ``test/management_tests/procedures/<family>/test_<name>.py``.
  3. Replace ``NotImplementedError`` with the implementation and un-skip tests.
