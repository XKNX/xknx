### HA integration

- knx_event: renamed `address` to `destination` and added `source`, `telegramtype`, `direction` attributes.

### Internals

- Tunnel connections process DisconnectRequest now and closes/reconnects the tunnel when the other side closes gracefully
- XKNX.connected Event can be used in future to await for a working connection or stop/relaunch tasks if the connection is lost
- Lower heartbeat rate from every 15sec to every 70 sec and raise ConnectionstateRequest timeout from 1 to 10sec (3/8/1 KNXip Overview ยง5.8 Timeout Constants)
- clean up Tunnel class
- refactored timeout handling in GatewayScanner, RequestResponse and ValueReader.
- renamed "PhysicalAddress" to "IndividualAddress"
- Telegram: `group_address` renamed to `destination_address`, to prepare support for other APCI services and add `source_address`
- Telegram: remove `Telegram.telegramtype` and replace with payload object derived from `xknx.telegram.apci.APCI`.
- CEMIFrame: remove `CEMIFrame.cmd`, which can be derived from `CEMIFrame.payload`.
- APCI: extend APCI services (e.g. `MemoryRead/Write/Response`, `PropertyRead/Write/Response`, etc).
- Farewell Travis CI; Welcome Github Actions!
- StateUpdater allow float values for `register_remote_value(tracker_options)` attribute.
- Handle exceptions from received unsupported or not implemented KNXIP Service Type identifiers

## 0.15.6 Bugfix for StateUpater 2020-11-26

### Bugfixes

- StateUpdater: shield from cancellation so update_received() don't cancel ongoing RemoteValue.read_state()

## 0.15.5 A Telegram for everyone 2020-11-25

### Internals

- process every incoming Telegram in all Devices, regardless if a callback for the GA is registered (eg. StateUpdater) or not.

### Bugfixes

- StateUpdater: always close the update task before starting a new in StateTracker
- Cover: separate target and state position RemoteValue to fix position update from RemoteValue and call `after_update()`

## 0.15.4 Bugfix for switch 2020-11-22

### Devices

- Light, Switch: initialize state with `None` instead of `False` to account for unknown state.
- Cover: `device_class` may be used to store the type of cover for Home-Assistant.
- HA-Entity Light, Switch, Cover: initialize with `assumed_state = True` until we have received a state.

### Bugfixes

- Switch.after_update was not called from RemoteValueSwitch.read_state (StateUpdater). Moved Switch.state to RemoteValue again.
- StateUpdater: query less aggressive - 2 parallel reads with 2 seconds timeout (instead of 3 - 1).

## 0.15.3 Opposite day! 2020-10-29

### Devices

- BinarySensor: added option to invert payloads
- BinarySensor: `ignore_internal_state` and counter are only applied to GroupValueWrite telegrams, not GroupValueRespond.
- BinarySensor: if `context_timeout` is set `ignore_internal_state` is set to True.
- Switch: added option to invert payloads

### Bugfixes

- HA Switch entity: keep state without state_address
- Cover: fix `set_position` without writable position / auto_stop_if_necessary
- handle unsupported CEMI Messages without loosing tunnel connection

## 0.15.2 Winter is coming

### Devices

- ClimateMode: Refactor climate modes in operation_mode and controller_mode, also fixes a bug for binary operation modes where the mode would be set to AWAY no matter what value was sent to the bus.
- Sensor: Add `always_callback` option
- Switch: Allow resetting switches after x seconds with the new `reset_after` option.

### Internals

- StateUpdater: Only request 3 GAs at a time.
- RemoteValue: Add support for passive group addresses

## 0.15.1 bugfix for binary sensors

### Devices

- BinarySensor: `reset_after` expects seconds, instead of ms now (to use same unit as `context_timeout`)
- Binary Sensor: Change the default setting `context_timeout` for binary sensor from 1.0 to 0.0 and fixes a bug that would result in the update callback being executed twice thus executing certain automations in HA twice for binary sensor from 1.0 to 0.0 and fixes a bug that would result in the update callback being executed twice thus executing certain automations in HA twice.

## 0.15.0 Spring cleaning and quality of life changes

### Logging

- An additional `log_directory` parameter has been introduced that allows you to log your KNX logs to a dedicated file. We will likely silence more logs over the time but this option will help you and us to triage issues easier in the future. It is disabled by default.

### Internals

- The heartbeat task, that is used to monitor the state of the tunnel and trigger reconnects if it doesn't respond, is now properly stopped once we receive the first reconnect request
- `XKNX.start()` no longer takes arguments. They are now passed directly to the constructor when instantiating `XKNX()`
- Support for python 3.6 has been dropped
- XKNX can now be used as an asynchronous context manager
- Internal refactorings

## 0.14.0 New sensor types and refactoring of binary sensor automations

### Breaking changes

- Binary sensor automations within the home assistant integration have been refactored to use the HA built in events as automation source instead of having the automation schema directly attached to the sensors. (Migration Guide: https://xknx.io/migration_ha_0116.html)

## 0.12.0 New StateUpdater, improvements to the HA integrations and bug fixes 2020-08-14

### Breaking changes

- Climate: `setpoint_shift_step` renamed for `temperature_step`. This attribute can be applied to all temperature modes. Default is `0.1`
- Removed significant_bit attribute in BinarySensor
- DateTime devices are initialized with sting for broadcast_type: "time", "date" or "datetime" instead of an Enum value
- Removed `bind_to_multicast` option in ConnectionConfig and UDPClient

### New Features

- Cover: add optional `group_address_stop` for manual stopping
- Cover: start travel calculator when up/down telegram from bus is received

- enable multicast on macOS and fix a bug where unknown cemi frames raise a TypeError on routing connections
- BinarySensor: reset_after is now implemented as asyncio.Task to prevent blocking the loop
- ClimateMode: binary climate modes should be fully functional now (sending, receiving and syncing)
- Cover: position update from bus does update current position, but not target position (when moving)

### Internals

- Cover travelcalculator doesn't start from 0% but is initialized by first movement or status telegram
- Cover uses 0% for open cover and 100% for closed cover now
- DPT classes can now be searched via value_type string or dpt number from any parent class (DPTBase for all) to be used in Sensor

### More asyncio:

More intense usage of asyncio. All device operations and callback functions are now async.

E.g. to switch on a light you have to do:

```python
await light.set_on()
```

See updated [examples](https://github.com/XKNX/xknx/tree/master/examples) for details.

### Renaming of several objects:

The naming of some device were changed in order to get the nomenclature closer to several other automation projects and to avoid confusion. The device objects were also moved into `xknx.devices`.

#### Climate

Renamed class `Thermostat` to `Climate` . Plase rename the section within configuration:

```yaml
groups:
  climate:
    Cellar.Thermostat: { group_address_temperature: "6/2/0" }
```

#### Cover

Renamed class `Shutter` to `Cover`. Plase rename the section within configuration:

```yaml
groups:
  cover:
    Livingroom.Shutter_1:
      {
        group_address_long: "1/4/1",
        group_address_short: "1/4/2",
        group_address_position_feedback: "1/4/3",
        group_address_position: "1/4/4",
        travel_time_down: 50,
        travel_time_up: 60,
      }
```

#### Binary Sensor

Renamed class `Switch` to `BinarySensor`. Plase rename the section within configuration:

```yaml
groups:
  binary_sensor:
    Kitchen.3Switch1:
      group_address: "5/0/0"
```

Sensors with `value_type=binary` are now integrated into the `BinarySensor` class:

```yaml
groups:
  binary_sensor:
    SleepingRoom.Motion.Sensor:
      { group_address: "6/0/0", device_class: "motion" }
    ExtraRoom.Motion.Sensor: { group_address: "6/0/1", device_class: "motion" }
```

The attribute `significant_bit` is now only possible within `binary_sensors`:

```yaml
groups:
  binary_sensor_motion_dection:
    Kitchen.Thermostat.Presence:
      { group_address: "3/0/2", device_class: "motion", significant_bit: 2 }
```

#### Switch

Renamed `Outlet` to `Switch` (Sorry for the confusion...). The configuration now looks like:

```yaml
groups:
  switch:
    Livingroom.Outlet_1: { group_address: "1/3/1" }
    Livingroom.Outlet_2: { group_address: "1/3/2" }
```

Within `Light` class i introduced an attribute `group_address_brightness_state`. The attribute `group_address_state` was renamed to `group_address_switch_state`. I also removed the attribute `group_address_dimm` (which did not have any implemented logic).

## Version 0.6.2 - Released 2017-07-24

XKNX Tunnel now does hartbeat - and reopens connections which are no longer valid.

## Version 0.6.0 - Released 2017-07-23

Using `asyncio` interface, XKNX has now to be stated and stopped asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX, Outlet

async def main():
    xknx = XKNX()
    await xknx.start()
    outlet = Outlet(xknx,
                    name='TestOutlet',
                    group_address='1/1/11')
    outlet.set_on()
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    outlet.set_off()
    await xknx.stop()

# pylint: disable=invalid-name
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
loop.close()
```

`sync_state` was renamed to `sync`:

````python
await sensor2.sync()
```
````
