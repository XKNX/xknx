# [](#header-1)The XKNX Object

# [](#header-2)Overview

The `XKNX()` object is the core element of any XKNX installation. It should be only initialized once per implementation. The XKNX object is responsible for:

- connecting to a KNX/IP device and managing the connection
- processing all incoming KNX telegrams
- organizing all connected devices and keeping their state
- updating all connected devices from time to time
- keeping the global configuration

# [](#header-2)Initialization

```python
xknx = XKNX(
    address_format=GroupAddressType.LONG,
    connection_state_changed_cb=None,
    telegram_received_cb=None,
    device_updated_cb=None,
    rate_limit=0,
    multicast_group=DEFAULT_MCAST_GRP,
    multicast_port=DEFAULT_MCAST_PORT,
    log_directory=None,
    state_updater=False,
    daemon_mode=False,
    connection_config=ConnectionConfig()
)
```

The constructor of the XKNX object takes several parameters:

- `address_format` may be used to specify the type of group addresses to use. Possible values are:
  - FREE: integer or hex representation
  - SHORT: representation like '1/34' without middle groups
  - LONG: representation like '1/2/34' with middle groups
- `connection_state_changed_cb` is a callback which is called every time the connection state to the gateway changes. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
- `telegram_received_cb` is a callback which is called after every received KNX telegram. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
- `device_updated_cb` is an async callback after a [XKNX device](#devices) was updated. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
- `rate_limit` in telegrams per second - can be used to limit the outgoing traffic to the KNX/IP interface by the telegram queue. `0` disables rate limiter. Disabled by default.
- `multicast_group` is the multicast group used for discovery - can be used to override the default multicast address (`224.0.23.12`)
- `multicast_port` is the multicast port used for discovery - can be used to override the default multicast port (`3671`)
- `log_directory` is the path to the log directory - when set to a valid directory we log to a dedicated file in this directory called `xknx.log`. The log files are rotated each night and will exist for 7 days. After that the oldest one will be deleted.
- `state_updater` is used to set the default state-updating mechanism used by devices. `False` to  disable state-updating by default, `True` to use default 60 minutes expire-interval, a number between 2 to 1440 to configure expire-time or a string "expire 50", "every 90" for strict periodically update or "init" for update when a connection is established. Default: `False`.
- if `daemon_mode` is set, start will only stop if Control-X is pressed. This function is useful for using XKNX as a daemon, e.g. for using the callback functions or using the internal action logic.
- `connection_config` replaces a ConnectionConfig() that was read from a yaml config file.

# [](#header-2)Connection configuration

```python
from xknx.io import ConnectionConfig, ConnectionType, SecureConfig

secure_config = SecureConfig(
    knxkeys_file_path="/Users/me/xknx/Keyfile.knxkeys",
    knxkeys_password="secret",
)
connection_config = ConnectionConfig(
    connection_type=ConnectionType.TUNNELING_TCP_SECURE,
    gateway_ip="10.1.0.123",
    individual_address="1.0.240",
    secure_config=secure_config,
)
xknx = XKNX(connection_config=connection_config)
```

An explicit connection configuration can be used. In this case a `connection_type` other than `ConnectionType.AUTOMATIC` shall be passed.
KNX Data Secure credentials are sourced from a keyfile exported from ETS.
IP Secure keys can be configured directly or sourced from a keyfile.

A specific tunnel endpoint can be requested by setting `individual_address`.
For AUTOMATIC connections this setting selects a host from a given keyfile.
For TCP TUNNELING connections this setting requests a tunnel to that individual address.
For SECURE tunnels this setting selects an interface from a given keyfile.

# [](#header-2)Starting

```python
await xknx.start()
```

`xknx.start()` will search for KNX/IP devices in the network and either build a KNX/IP-Tunnel or open a multicast KNX/IP-Routing connection. `start()` will not take any parameters.

# [](#header-2)Stopping

```python
await xknx.stop()
```

Will disconnect from tunneling devices and stop the different queues.

# [](#header-2)Using XKNX as an asynchronous context manager

You can also use an asynchronous context manager instead of calling `xknx.start()` and `xknx.stop()`:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with XKNX() as xknx:
        switch = Switch(xknx,
                name='TestSwitch',
                group_address='1/1/11'
        )
        xknx.devices.async_add(switch)

        await switch.set_on()

asyncio.run(main())
```

# [](#header-2)Devices

To attach a device to XKNX call `xknx.devices.async_add(device)`. Added devices may be accessed by their name: `xknx.devices['NameOfDevice']`. When an update via KNX GroupValueWrite or GroupValueResponse was received devices will be updated accordingly.
To remove a device from XKNX call `xknx.devices.async_remove(device)`. Removed devices can be re-added at a later point. This cancels background tasks of that device and disconnects it from receiving new telegrams.

Example:

```python
switch = Switch(
    xknx,
    name='TestSwitch',
    group_address='1/1/11'
)
xknx.devices.async_add(switch)

await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_on()
await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_off()
```

# [](#header-2)Callbacks

An awaitable `telegram_received_cb` will be called for each KNX telegram received by the XKNX daemon. Example:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX
from xknx.telegram import Telegram

async def telegram_received_cb(telegram: Telegram):
    print("Telegram received: {0}".format(telegram))

async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(telegram_received_cb=telegram_received_cb, daemon_mode=True)
    await xknx.start()
    await xknx.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

For all devices stored in the `devices` storage (see [above](#devices)) a callback for each update may be defined:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX
from xknx.devices import Device, Switch


async def device_updated_cb(device: Device):
    print("Callback received from {0}".format(device.name))


async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(device_updated_cb=device_updated_cb, daemon_mode=True)
    switch = Switch(xknx,
                    name='TestSwitch',
                    group_address='1/1/11')

    await xknx.start()
    await xknx.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

An awaitable `connection_state_changed_cb` will be called every time the connection state to the gateway changes. Example:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX
from xknx.core import XknxConnectionState


async def connection_state_changed_cb(state: XknxConnectionState):
    print("Callback received with state {0}".format(state.name))


async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(connection_state_changed_cb=connection_state_changed_cb, daemon_mode=True)
    await xknx.start()
    await xknx.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```
