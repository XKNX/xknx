# [](#header-1)The XKNX Object

# [](#header-2)Overview

The `XKNX()` object is the core element of any XKNX installation. It should be only initialized once per implementation. The XKNX object is responsible for:

* connectiong to a KNX/IP device and managing the connection
* processing all incoming KNX telegrams
* organizing all connected devices and keeping their state
* updating all connected devices from time to time
* keeping the global configuration

# [](#header-2)Initialization

```python
xknx = XKNX(config='xknx.yaml',
            loop=loop,
            own_address=Address,
            address_format=GroupAddressType.LONG
            telegram_received_cb=None,
            device_updated_cb=None,
            rate_limit=DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT,
            multicast_group=DEFAULT_MCAST_GRP,
            multicast_port=DEFAULT_MCAST_PORT,
            log_directory=None,
            state_updater=False,
            daemon_mode=False,
            connection_config=ConnectionConfig())
```

The constructor of the XKNX object takes several parameters:

* `config` defines a path to the local [XKNX.yaml](/configuration).
* `loop` points to the asyncio.loop object. Of not specified it uses `asyncio.get_event_loop()`.
* `own_address` may be used to specify the individual (physical) KNX address of the XKNX daemon. If not speficied it uses `15.15.250`.
* `address_format` may be used to specify the type of group addresses to use. Possible values are:
** FREE: integer or hex representation
** SHORT: representation like '1/34' without middle groups
** LONG: representation like '1/2/34' with middle groups
* `telegram_received_cb` is a callback which is called after every received KNX telegram. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
* `device_updated_cb` is an async callback after a [XKNX device](#devices) was updated. See [callbacks](#callbacks) documentation for details.
* `rate_limit` in telegrams per second - can be used to limit the outgoing traffic to the KNX/IP interface. The default value is 20 packets per second.
* `multicast_group` is the multicast IP address - can be used to override the default multicast address (`224.0.23.12`)
* `multicast_port` is the multicast port - can be used to override the default multicast port (`3671`)
* `log_directory` is the path to the log directory - when set to a valid directory we log to a dedicated file in this directory called `xknx.log`. The log files are rotated each night and will exist for 7 days. After that the oldest one will be deleted.
* if `state_updater` is set, XKNX will start (once `start() is called) an asynchronous process for syncing the states of all connected devices every hour
* if `daemon_mode` is set, start will only stop if Control-X is pressed. This function is useful for using XKNX as a daemon, e.g. for using the callback functions or using the internal action logic.
* `connection_config` replaces a ConnectionConfig() that was read from a yaml config file.

# [](#header-2)Starting

```python
await xknx.start()
```

`xknx.start()` will search for KNX/IP devices in the network and either build a KNX/IP-Tunnel or open a mulitcast KNX/IP-Routing connection. `start()` will not take any parameters.

# [](#header-2)Stopping

```python
await xknx.stop()
```

Will disconnect from tunneling devices and stop the different queues.

# [](#header-2)Using XKNX as an asynchronous context manager

You can also use an asynchronous context manager instead of calling `xknx.start()` and `xknx.stop()`:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with XKNX() as xknx:
        switch = Switch(xknx,
                name='TestSwitch',
                group_address='1/1/11')

        await switch.set_on()

asyncio.run(main())
```

# [](#header-2)Devices

XKNX keeps all initialized devices in a local storage named `devices`. All devices may be accessed by their name: `xknx.devices['NameOfDevice']`. When an update via KNX GroupValueWrite or GroupValueResponse was received devices will be updated accordingly.

Example:

```python
switch = Switch(xknx,
                name='TestSwitch',
                group_address='1/1/11')

await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_on()
await xknx.devices['TestSwitch'].set_off()
```


# [](#header-2)Callbacks

An awaitable `telegram_received_cb` will be called for each KNX telegram received by the XKNX daemon. Example:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX

async def telegram_received_cb(telegram):
    print("Telegram received: {0}".format(telegram))

async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(telegram_received_cb=telegram_received_cb, daemon_mode=True)
    await xknx.start()
    await xknx.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

For all devices stored in the `devices` storage (see [above](#devices)) a callback for each update may be defined:

```python
import asyncio
from xknx import XKNX
from xknx.devices import Switch


async def device_updated_cb(device):
    print("Callback received from {0}".format(device.name))


async def main():
    xknx = XKNX(device_updated_cb=device_updated_cb, daemon_mode=True)
    switch = Switch(xknx,
                    name='TestSwitch',
                    group_address='1/1/11')

    await xknx.start()
    await xknx.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

# [](#header-2)Dockerised xknx's app

To run xknx from a container, set 'route_back=true' or use host network mode.

Available env variables are:
- XKNX_GENERAL_OWN_ADDRESS
- XKNX_GENERAL_RATE_LIMIT
- XKNX_GENERAL_MULTICAST_GROUP
- XKNX_GENERAL_MULTICAST_PORT
- XKNX_CONNECTION_GATEWAY_IP: Your KNX Gateway IP address
- XKNX_CONNECTION_GATEWAY_PORT: Your KNX Gateway UDP port
- XKNX_CONNECTION_LOCAL_IP
- XKNX_CONNECTION_ROUTE_BACK: Set 'true' to be able to work in a container

Example of a `docker run` with an xknx based app:

```bash
docker run --name myapp -d \
  -e XKNX_CONNECTION_GATEWAY_IP='192.168.0.123' \
  -e XKNX_CONNECTION_LOCAL_PORT=12399 \
  -e XKNX_CONNECTION_ROUTE_BACK=true \
  -p 12300:12399/udp \
  myapp:latest
```
