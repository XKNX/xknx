Configuration
=============

Overview
--------

XKNX is controlled via a configuration file. Per default the configuration file is  named `xknx.yaml`. 

The configuration file can contain three sections.

- The `general` section can contain:
  - `own_address` the individual / physical address of the XKNX daemon
  - `rate_limit` a rate limit for telegrams sent to the bus
- The `connection` section can be used to specify the connection to the KNX interface.
  - `auto` for automatic discovery of a KNX interface
  - `tunneling` for a UDP unicast connection
    - `gateway_ip` (required) sets the ip address of the KNX tunneling interface
    - `gateway_port` (optional) sets the port the KNX tunneling interface is listening on
    - `local_ip` (optional) sets the ip address that is used by xknx
  - `routing` for a UDP multicast connection
    - `local_ip` (optional) sets the ip address that is used by xknx
- Within the `groups` sections all devices are defined. For each type of device more then one section might be specified. You need to append numbers or strings to differentiate the entries, as in the example below. The appended number or string must be unique. 

How to use
----------

Use the `config` attribute when initializing `XKNX` to spefify a configuration file:

```python
xknx = XKNX(config='xknx.yaml')

for device in xknx.devices:
    print(device)
```
