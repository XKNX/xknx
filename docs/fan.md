# [](#header-1)Fans

## [](#header-2)Overview

Fans are simple representations of KNX controlled fans. They support setting the speed.

## [](#header-2)Interface

- `xknx` XKNX object.
- `name` name of the device.
- `group_address` is the KNX group address of the fan device. Used for sending.
- `group_address_state` is the KNX group address of the fan state. Used for updating and reading state.
- `device_updated_cb` awaitable callback for each update.
- `max_step` Maximum step amount for fans which are controlled with steps and not percentage.

## [](#header-2)Example

```python
fan = Fan(xknx,
              'TestFan',
              group_address='1/2/1',
              group_address_state='1/2/2')

# Set the fan speed
await fan.set_speed(50)

# Accessing speed
print(fan.current_speed)

# Requesting state via KNX GroupValueRead
await fan.sync()
```

## [](#header-2)Configuration via **xknx.yaml**

Fans are usually configured via [`xknx.yaml`](/configuration):

```yaml
groups:
    fan:
        Livingroom.Fan_1: {group_address: '1/4/1', group_address_state: '1/4/2' }
```
