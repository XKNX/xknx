# [](#header-1)Light & Dimmer

## [](#header-2)Overview

The Light object is either a representation of a binary or dimm actor, LED-controller or DALI-gateway.

Expected datapoint types for light functions and their corresponding state addresses:
- switch: DPT 1.001
- brightness: DPT 5.001
- color: DPT 232.600
- rgbw: DPT 251.600
- tunable_white: DPT 5.001
- color_temperature: DPT 7.600

## [](#header-2)Example

```python
light = Light(xknx,
              name='TestLight',
              group_address_switch='1/2/3',
              group_address_brightness='1/2/5')

# Accessing light
await xknx.devices['TestLight'].set_on()
await xknx.devices['TestLight'].set_brightness(23)
```

## [](#header-2)Configuration via **xknx.yaml**

Lights are usually configured via [`xknx.yaml`](/configuration):

```yaml
groups:
    light:

        # Lights with dimming
        Kitchen.Light_1:     {group_address_switch: '1/6/1', group_address_brightness: '1/6/3'}
        Diningroom.Light_1:  {group_address_switch: '1/6/4', group_address_brightness: '1/6/6'}

        # Light without dimming
        Living-Room.Light_1: {group_address_switch: '1/6/7'}

        # Light with extra addresses for states:
        Office.Light_1:  {group_address_switch: '1/7/4', group_address_switch_state: '1/7/5', group_address_brightness: '1/7/6', group_address_brightness_state: '1/7/7'}

        # Light with color temperature in Kelvin
        Living-Room.Light_CT:  {group_address_switch: '1/6/11', group_address_switch_state: '1/6/10', group_address_brightness: '1/6/12', group_address_brightness_state: '1/6/13', group_address_color_temperature: '1/6/14',  group_address_color_temperature_state: '1/6/15'}

        # Light with color temperature in percent
        Living-Room.Light_TW:  {group_address_switch: '1/6/21', group_address_switch_state: '1/6/20', group_address_brightness: '1/6/22', group_address_brightness_state: '1/6/23', group_address_tunable_white: '1/6/24',  group_address_tunable_white_state: '1/6/25'}

```

# Switching light on
await light.set_on()

# Switching light off
await light.set_off()

# Set brightness
await light.set_brightness(23)

# Set color
await light.set_color((20, 70,200))

# Set rgbw color
await light.set_color((20,70,200), 30)

# Set relative color temperature (percent)
await set_tunable_white(25)

# Set absolute color temperature (Kelvin)
await set_color_temperature(3300)

# Accessing light via 'do'
