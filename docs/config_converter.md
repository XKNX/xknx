# [](#header-1)Migrating from xknx.yaml configuration

Using xknx.yaml form Home-Assistant is deprecated. Configure xknx from the Home-Assistant integration in your configuration.yaml. This uses a different Schema - for documentation have a look at [Home-Assistant Integration docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/knx/).

If you have a working xknx.yaml we have a converter for you!
